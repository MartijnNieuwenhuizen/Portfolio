    <p class="note">
		I recently attended a view congresses about web development and there was alway’s some talk about progressive enhancement, and why we should do this. And I agree, you should definitely progressive enhance everything you build, but what do you say when someone asks you ‘Why?’.

    <p>
        Let’s start with the classic reason: This is for everyone. The Tweet from Tim Berners Lee say’s it all.
        He created the web for everyone, so in that train of thought, you shouldn’t exclude anyone.
        This means also the people without a fancy MacBook, new browser, and a lightning fast internet connection.
    </p>

    <h2>Nobody uses my site without JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        Well, that’s just not true! Not having JS doesn’t mean JS is disabled.
        It can simply mean that someone has a browser that doesn’t support JS or a bit of your JS.
        Or someone’s internet connection isn’t that quick. They shouldn’t be punished for this!
        Especially when progressive enhancement is so simple, if you do it the right way.
    </p>

    <h2>This is how simple Progressive Enhancement can be</h2>
    <p>
        If, for instance, you want to create a web app where people can indicate when they will be in the office, your HTML of your calendar might look something like this:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
        <span class="break-1">&lt;ul class=”calendar-container”></span>
          <span class="break-2">{#each days}</span>
            <span class="break-3">&lt;li class=”calendar-days — item”&gt;</span>
              <span class="break-4">&lt;input id=”{{@key}}” type=”checkbox” name=”{{fullDate}}”&gt;</span>
              <span class="break-4">&lt;label for=”{{@key}}”&gt;{{@key}}&lt;/label&gt;</span>
              <span class="break-4">&lt;span class=”amount”&gt;{{indication}}%&lt;/span&gt;</span>
            <span class="break-3">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
          <span class="break-2">{/each}</span>
        <span class="break-1">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
    </p>
    <p><i>This is a Handlebars template which will create a 'li' for every day in a month</i></p>

    <p>
        You can request all the data from your MongoDB with a JavaScript API call and let the client handle the logistics.
        Getting the data, transforming the data, calculating, rewriting data and storing it again. Now that isn’t really work for a client.
        That’s the server’s job.
    </p>

    <h2>So how would that look like</h2>
    <p>
        In your JavaScript file, you will make a GET request to ‘/calendar’. Your server can response to this request.
        If your server requests and handle the data you can create a response for this request with the required data for the client.
        You will just have to insert/change the response on the client side, without having to do all the calculations.
    </p>

    <p>
        In your JavaScript file, you will make a GET request to ‘/calendar’. Your server can response to this request.
        If your server requests and handle the data you can create a response for this request with the required data for the client.
        You will just have to insert/change the response on the client side, without having to do all the calculations.
    </p>

    <h2>You already git it</h2>
    <p>
        You just wrote a response to a GET request, done by an API call. But if you will go to www.your-url.com/calendar' will also send a request to ‘/calendar’.
        This means you can use the same code on the server to request something with an API call or a browser.
    </p>

    <h2>The other way around</h2>
    <p>
        There’s one thing wrong here, the order in which this is done.
        This is the right way it should be done:
    </p>

    <p><strong>1. Create your html</strong></p>
    <p class="code">
        <span class="break-1"> &lt;form action=”/” method=”post”&gt; </span>
           <span class="break-2"> &lt;ul class=”calendar-container”&gt; </span>
            <span class="break-3"> {{#each days}} </span>
              <span class="break-4"> &lt;li class=”calendar-days — item”&gt; </span>
                <span class="break-5"> &lt;input id=”{{@key}}” type=”checkbox” name=”{{fullDate}}”&gt; </span>
                <span class="break-5"> &lt;label for=”{{@key}}”&gt;{{@key}}&lt;/label&gt; </span>
                <span class="break-5"> &lt;span class=”amount”&gt;{{indication}}%&lt;/span&gt; </span>
              <span class="break-4"> &lt;/li&gt; </span>
            <span class="break-3"> {{/each}} </span>
          <span class="break-2"> &lt;/ul&gt; </span>
        <span class="break-1"> &lt;/form&gt; </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        Just like a GET request, you can use the same code for a POST request.
        A form can make this request for you and if you want to do it on the web app way, include a JS POST request and make changes depending on the response.
    </p>

    <p><strong>2. Write code on the server side,</strong> like described above.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>3. Write the client side JS if you want to create a web app.</strong>All the logical bits are already dealt with. You only need to display it!
    </p>

    <p>
        So an argument like “because it’s hard” just isn’t true! If you start where you need to start and work your way up, you will get a more reliable web app and with a tiny amount of work, you can create your awesome web app, just start with the right HTML and server side code.
    </p>

    <h2>Wrapping-up</h2>
    <p>
        If done right, Progressive Enhancement isn’t that hard. But this is just a tiny bit of why and how you should Progressive enhance anything, so there are more posts coming about it! Follow me if you want a notification for the next story.
