	<p class="intro">
		The Akzidenz Grotesk project was a school assignment by Robert Crain. We focused on a combination of the Concept, Design and Interaction.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Assignment: <b>"What is the current value of the Akzidenz Grotesk in the Graphical Desing of 2015"</b> (<span class="color-font">now</span>)

	<h2>The Thought</h2>
	<p>
		The Akzidenz Grotesk provided the Swiss Style movement where Graphical Design was brought down to clear, understandable and readable design. I think this was the beginning of the “template”. So it was the beginning of creating something based on a set of rules.	
	</p>
	<p>
		This means a lot of developers (at this moment) are creating websites that all look-a-like because color, font, spacing and used elements a part of a Thema.

	<h2>The Solution</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A Non-digital pole that provides variation and surprise in your Design.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		This pole is meant for the Flexible workspaces, developers use. If a developer is creating a new website and types
		<span class="code">font-family: "Open Sans", Sans-Serif;</span> 
		it’s time to stand up and walk to the pole. 	
	</p>
	<p>
		Once arrived, he can create the layout with the 120 cards that are provided with it. So let’s say: A big header, piece of text, introduction to your team, introduction to your company, footer. The developer creates his layout at the four different sides of the pole and starts spinning the sections. Every section-option has a different font, color, layout or/and sense. Therefore, after spinning 5 times, you will have 4 completely different layout’s which can inspire you. So you will not use Open Sans, a sea-green color and Hero Images in every project.
